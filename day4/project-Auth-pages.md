I’ve created a **Mini Project: Auth Pages (Login & Signup)** in the canvas.

This project is **exactly aligned with real frontend / full-stack job work**:

* Used in **every product**
* Matches **company UI standards**
* Backend-ready for **FastAPI / Node authentication**
* Strong **portfolio + interview value**

### Why this project is very important for you 💼

If an interviewer asks:

> “Have you worked on authentication UI?”

👉 This project is a **perfect real answer**.

### How I recommend you proceed (important):

1. Build this project **by yourself** (don’t just copy)
2. Push to **GitHub**
3. Add screenshots to your **portfolio**
4. Then extend it step-by-step

---

### What we can do next (choose one):

* 🔹 **Connect Login/Signup to FastAPI backend**
* 🔹 **Add form validation (React Hook Form)**
* 🔹 **JWT authentication flow**
* 🔹 **Dark mode + theme toggle**
* 🔹 **Mock interview questions from this project**

Tell me what you want next 👍
